<h1>Ascender Readme</h1>
<p>
Ascender is a server replacement for the game Ascend: Hand of Kul, which has shut down. This is more of a proof-of-concept, so expect bugs to occur. And no, we are not the original developers of the game, and we are not in any way endorsed or affiliated with Signal Studios.
</p>
<h2>
Installation
</h2>
<p>
<emp>The NEW and IMPROVED launcher</emp> should do it automatically for you, which you can get through our Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/PpgHEB8">Discord server</a>
</p>
<p>
Should the launcher not install the game for you, click on the link to start the game on Steam:
<a href="steam://install/233630">Install Ascend: Hand of Kul on Steam</a>
</p>
<p>
Don't have Steam installed? You should have it installed first! Go install it now.
</p>

<h2>
Playing the game
</h2>
<p>
<eml>Simply start the launcher you downloaded</eml> from our Discord server. Enjoy!
</p>
<p>
<emr><b>IMPORTANT: <i><u>Do not</u></i> start the game from Steam.</b></emr> This is the launcher you should use, unless specifically required.
</p>
<h2>
Common issues
</h2>
<p>
<ul>

<li>
Crashes on some AMD Ryzen processors
<p>
A bug in the game engine causes the game to crash. Download the patched version of the game from our Discord server and put it in the game's bin folder.
</p>
</li>
<li>
XINPUT1_3.dll and d3dx9_43.dll error
<p>
Please install DirectX 9 Runtime from Microsoft. This does not come pre-installed on Windows 10.
</p>
</li>
<li>
"Ascend Service Not Available"
<p>
Use the launcher to start the game. <emr><u>NOT</u></emr> from Steam.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Game crashes or black-screens when Alt-tabbing
<p>
Use Windowed mode. (Click Play on Steam, click on Use Launcher, set the window mode to Windowed, click Launch then close the game)
</p>
</li>
<li>
Where did the launcher go? I'm sure I downloaded  it...
<p>
Your antivirus program (which may include your built-in Windows Defender) is deleting the file due to a false positive match. Add the launcher executable to the exception list, disable the antivirus while playing or use other antivirus programs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Invalid Resolution error
<p>
This may happen when you first start the game. Click Play on Steam, click on Use Launcher, set the desired resolution, click Launch, close the game and try again.
</p>
</li>

<li>
The launcher does not start
<p>
Unpack the full archive (consult G**gle or other search engines if you have no idea how to do so) into a folder then try again.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Game does not work on Windows 10 despite trying everything
<p>
Try reinstalling the game outside of the default folder. This is not a recommended fix, but it sometimes resolves the issue on Windows 10 systems. Before you try this, try other solutions first.
