Crap for my GitHub site

## IF YOU HAVE PROBLEM WITH MY STUFF CONTACT ME DIRECTLY
You're endangering my future careers by sending DMCA takedown notices.

I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO COMPLY WITH YOUR REMOVAL REQUESTS. 

PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT HARD FOR ALL OF US. PLEASE.

## lawyers.txt
Please contact me first before taking actions, no matter how agitated your client is.

Please allow up to 5 business days before taking action, I will get back in touch as soon as possible.

I know you want to finish your task fast, but I'm human. I make mistakes.  I want to make it right.

If you contact me first, I'll do what you or your client want me to do (removal of said content) and both you, your client and I will be happy, no drama.

Don't make my life even more miserable by not contacting me, please? It's as easy as sending that notice to me instead of GitHub.

You can find the contact info on my GitHub page, https://unforeseenocean.github.io
