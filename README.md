Crap for my GitHub site

## IF YOU HAVE PROBLEM WITH MY STUFF CONTACT ME DIRECTLY
GITHUB'S DMCA NOTICE SYSTEM IS UNRELIABLE and you're endangering my future careers by sending DMCA takedown notices.

I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO COMPLY WITH YOUR REMOVAL REQUESTS. 

PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT HARD FOR ALL OF US. PLEASE.

## lawyers.txt
Please do a more thorough search before sending DMCA takedown notices, especially look at my profile first.

As I said earlier, please contact me first before taking actions, no matter how agitated your client is.

Please allow up to 5 business days before taking action, I will get back in touch as soon as possible.

I know you want to finish your task fast, but I'm human. I make mistakes. 

If you contact me first, I'll do what you or your client want me to do (removal of said content) and both you, your client and I will be happy, no drama.

Don't make my life even more miserable by not contacting me, please? It's as easy as sending that notice to me instead of GitHub.

Hell, you don't even have to format it or anything. Just send me a link to the file(s) you want me to remove and a proof that you own the said content. Just be nice, no need to throw temper tantrum.

You can find the contact info on my GitHub page, https://unforeseenocean.github.io
