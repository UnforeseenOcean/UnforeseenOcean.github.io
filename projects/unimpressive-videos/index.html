      <b>So what is <i>Unimpressive Videos?</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a channel dedicated to uploading videos that don't fit well in the world of perfectionism -- the uploader is trying his best, but his best simply isn't enough to satisfy the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It started one day in 2022, when I realized that I won't ever be good enough to reach the heights others are reaching. Rather than just giving up and dragging the recording to the recycling bin, I decided to make a new channel and upload some failures that most people won't see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The channel was created with hopes of telling the beginners and others that everyone's imperfect and striving towards the ideal state simply leads to depression and agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also created to say that people like me exist and that everyone starts somewhere.
