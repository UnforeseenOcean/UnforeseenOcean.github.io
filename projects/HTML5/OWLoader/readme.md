# To-do
- Replacement font for Futura (Probably from Google Fonts) so the page doesn't come out like crap even when Futura Standard is not installed (Multiple fallback options, they'll look slightly different but I don't want to get sued for illegally sharing commercial fonts, sorry)
  - Reduced font for this purpose only (concatenated font which only contains most-used characters) could be done
- ~~Replace "fantasy" or "cursive" definition with "sans-serif" (remnant of debugging attempts)~~ :ballot_box_with_check:
- Make new screens
  - Map loading screen
  - Matchmaking loading screen
- Make index.html
  - It currently just redirects
