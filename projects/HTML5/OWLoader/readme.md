# To-do
- Replacement font for Futura (Probably from Google Fonts) so the page doesn't come out like crap even when Futura Standard is not installed (Multiple fallback options, they'll look slightly different but I don't want to get sued for illegally sharing commercial fonts, sorry)
  - Reduced font for this purpose only (concatenated font which only contains most-used characters) could be done
  - Found some pretty convincing free fonts
- ~~Replace "fantasy" or "cursive" definition with "sans-serif" (remnant of debugging attempts)~~ :ballot_box_with_check:
- Make new screens
  - Map loading screen
  - Matchmaking loading screen
- ~~Make index.html~~ :ballot_box_with_check:
  - ~~It currently just redirects~~ :ballot_box_with_check:

# Font is weird?
Install the following fonts, installing the one you have access to, from the first font. If you already have the fonts installed, ensure it's set to Visible.

Most fonts are available for free online, or on Google Fonts. (The Google Fonts problem will be addressed on the next release)

Starting with the bold big fonts:
- BigNoodleToo
- BigNoodleTitling
- Sturkopf Grotesk (install *all* variants)
- Bebas Neue (install *all* variants)

And for the regular fonts:

- Futura Nr.2
