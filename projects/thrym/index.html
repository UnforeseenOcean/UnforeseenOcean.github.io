                        <p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">He's a &quot;simple&quot; OpenCV powered Python robot that takes control of your other copy of the game on Steam (Windows only) so you always have someone to play against.</p>
						<p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">Thrym emerged from a blend of my frustration, boredom, and loneliness, serving as a virtual companion to alleviate the absence of friends. His primary objective is to fill the void of companionship in moments when genuine connections are lacking. In other words, you have the game. You have all the DLCs. But you're alone.</p>
						<p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">Running on a Windows platform, Thrym leverages OpenCV-Python and various other libraries to enhance his capabilities. These technological components contribute to his functionality and interaction, enabling him to engage with users on a virtual level.</p>
						<p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">Thrym's unique feature involves taking control of the keyboard connected to the host computer running the game. However, it's important to note that this interaction is limited to non-VR game modes. Thrym's influence adds an extra layer of dynamism to the gaming experience, creating a fusion of artificial intelligence and human control.</p>
						<p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">Users have the flexibility to customize Thrym's behavior, dictating whether he should adopt a more relaxed approach, tire more easily, or unleash an unbridled and intense gaming experience. This adaptability adds a personal touch, allowing users to tailor their interaction with Thrym based on individual preferences and mood.</p>
						<p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">Moreover, the entire project is open-source, emphasizing transparency and community collaboration. This means that all aspects of Thrym's design, code, and functionality can be modified and improved upon by users, adhering to specified license terms and an acceptable use policy. The open-source nature fosters innovation, enabling users to contribute to Thrym's development and explore new possibilities in the realm of virtual companionship and gaming interaction.</p>
						<p class="hero-paragraph is-revealing">He can be your friend, or your enemy. He does not judge, he does not get tired if you tell him not to be. He will always congratulate you on every small achievements you make, encouraging you to move forward. I hope you will enjoy his company.</p>
